# API Key
You'll need a FRED API key to get data from FRED and ALFRED.

You can get one right away by going to https://fred.stlouisfed.org/, making an account, then clicking on the profile icon in the top right at the home page and going to the "API Keys" section. Specify in your request that it's for your personal use.

Once you have it, you must set up your local clone of the repo my making a new .txt file and pasting the API key as the first line.
